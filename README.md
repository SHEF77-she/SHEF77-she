# 👋 Hello, I'm Shefali Bansal

Welcome to my GitHub!


🎨 I'm deeply passionate about **handmade handicrafts**, **handlooms**, and the **artistic heritage of India**.  

From the intricate weaves of the Northeast to the timeless embroidery of Kutch — I find beauty in the unique stories that art and culture tell across our diverse land.


## ✨ What I Do

I design **sarees and textiles** that celebrate India’s artistry — incorporating:

- Traditional **weaving techniques**

- Regional **embroidery styles**

- Heritage **painting forms**  

Each piece is a canvas of culture, created with care and vision.


## 🚀 Current Interests

I'm currently exploring **AI tools** to enhance my design process, streamline workflows, and take my business to the next level — blending tradition with technology.
